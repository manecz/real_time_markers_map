# Real Time Markers Map

In this project, I used Symfony to develop an API for create and show all markers.
For the real time thing, it was implemented an comunication protocol called Mercure.
Map based on leaflet, with a specific library for clustering markers.

The front-end has a lot of javascript code, for controlling user location by ip or gps. Its possible to restrict the map for a specific country, which prevents the creation of markers outside of their bounds.
